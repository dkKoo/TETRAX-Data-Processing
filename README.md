# TETRAX-Data-Processing
Data processing code for statistical analysis of Tetra-ataxiometric Posturography (TetraxⓇ Sunlight Medical Ltd., Ramat Gan, Israel).

Balance assessments are conducted using the Tetra-ataxiometric Posturography (TetraxⓇ Sunlight Medical Ltd., Ramat Gan, Israel). The dimensions of the forefoot force plates (left: B, right: D) are rectangular, measuring 12 cm in width and 19 cm in length, while the hindfoot plates (left: A, right: C) are square, each side measuring 12 cm. Pressure data from the subjects standing on these plates are amplified and filtered before being transmitted to a computer for analysis via the Tetrax software. Subjects are instructed to stand barefoot on the plates in a relaxed posture, arms at their sides, looking straight ahead. Movements are to be minimized during the test, and one practice trial is performed for posture stabilization before the actual assessment begins.

The test is carried out in eight different postures, demanding changes in visual and somatosensory input and various head positions (left, right, forward, and backward). Each posture lasts 32 seconds. The assessment starts with the subject looking straight ahead with open eyes (normal eye open, NO), followed by the same posture with eyes closed (normal eye close, NC), which emphasizes the role of the vestibular system or somatosensation in balance by limiting visual influence. Subsequent postures include turning the head at least 45 degrees to the right (head right, HR) and left (head left, HL), tilting the head back (head back, HB), and lowering the head forward (head forward, HF). These positions are sensitive to postural deviations, particularly in cases of vestibular or cervical/lumbar spine issues. The test is also conducted with the subject standing on a foam-rubber pillow, both with eyes open (pillow with eye open, PO) and closed (pillow with eye close, PC). The PO posture emphasizes visual influence on stability by limiting somatosensory input, indicating potential visual system abnormalities if stability is compromised. The PC posture stresses the vestibular system by limiting both visual and somatosensory inputs, indicating possible vestibular dysfunction if stability is reduced. If the subject steps off the plates or fails to maintain the required head position, the test is repeated. When eyes are closed or standing on the pillow, the examiner stays close to the subject to prevent falls.

Measured indices include the stability index (ST), Fourier index, weight distribution index (WDI), synchronization index (SI), and fall index (FI). The stability index represents overall stability by measuring the degree of postural sway on the four plates, with higher values indicating greater instability, suggesting frequent or significant changes in the percentage of weight borne by the plates. The Fourier index, derived from regression analysis of postural sway intensity using Fourier transformation, varies with the lesion location causing instability, with higher values indicating pathological conditions.

Low-frequency sway below 0.1 Hz (F1) occurs in stable postures, while sway in the low-to-mid frequency range (0.1–0.5 Hz, F2-4) is typically higher in vestibular disorders. Sway in the mid-to-high frequency range (0.5–1 Hz, F5-6) indicates disturbances in lower limb and spinal somatosensory responses, and sway above 1 Hz (F7-8) is elevated in central nervous system lesions. The weight distribution index reflects the distribution of weight across the four plates, with higher values indicating deviations from the normal 25% weight distribution, suggesting pathological conditions.

The synchronization index compares waveform patterns between two of the four vibrations measured on each plate, with six possible combinations. Negative synchronization indicates mirror image synchronization between waveforms, while positive synchronization indicates parallel synchronization. Negative synchronization is observed between the forefoot and hindfoot on each foot (plates AB, CD) and diagonally (plates AD, BC), and positive synchronization is observed between the forefoot (plates BD) or hindfoot (plates AC). The index ranges from -1,000 to 1,000, with normal values typically above 700 in absolute terms. Values lower than this, especially below 200, indicate impaired fine pedal postural control. The fall index is a composite score including the stability index, F3, F6, and the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient, quantitatively representing the risk of falling, with higher values indicating greater risk.
